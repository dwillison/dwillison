I am a full time student in my Junior year at Dakota State University, majoring in Cyber Operations. Part-time I develop tech related content and tutorials for a cyber education program. In my free time I enjoy listening to books, working out, and spending time with mentors, friends, and family.

I enjoy web development and programming, and am currently working with languages like C++, Python, PHP, and SQL. In the future, I would like to develop or contribute to a project that enables the Deaf community to sign to their phone or computer and have it translated into speech. In the meantime I am honing my skills by working on various smaller programming projects.
